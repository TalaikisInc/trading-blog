This months experienced the Bitcoin crash and results are mixed - most of the strategies performed above the zero, except most volatile - [V](https://blueblood.talaikis.com/bitcoin-v-trading-strategy) -4.87 and most previously profitable - [Pi 2.0](https://blueblood.talaikis.com/bitcoin-pi-2-trading-strategy) -10.59. This is as expected.

One strategy was a record ([One](https://blueblood.talaikis.com/bitcoin-one-trading-strategy) - 15.96), all others, except weekly (I don't take them into account in reviews) - from 0.44% (portfolio) to 8.69%.

So, indexing clearly shows it can protect from crashes.

Future plans. I am working on hourly ar minute Bitcoin bots when I can, but this will be long process until release.

Hourly bot expected performance (in sample + out of sample 1/2):

In regards of minute performance, it is too unreal (200%/ year) to show it here, and, most possibly, impossible to achieve due to various constraints.
