I told March was one of the best of this year, then April is a record month for 5 out of the 10 strategies! [Bitcoin Pi 2.0](https://blueblood.talaikis.com/bitcoin-pi-2-trading-strategy) is totally crazy here, almost 70% over just 4 months (of course, it has higher inherent risk).

[Bitcoin V](https://blueblood.talaikis.com/bitcoin-v-trading-strategy/), volatility based, new, just first month in operation generated record for the year too.

For the [portfolio of the strategies](https://blueblood.talaikis.com/bitcoin-idx-trading-strategy) month was also the record.

Returns ranged from 0 (weekly ones are no match for higher frequency trading) to 17.1% in just a month.

Also, I have redesigned this blog, but still it's not final. Stats that were displayed on the pages of the Bitcoin strategies currently do not work.
