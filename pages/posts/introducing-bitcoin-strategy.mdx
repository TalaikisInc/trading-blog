## Example API response

Each data point is indexed by daily Unix timestamp. Example: '1583193600000' means 'March 3, 2020'.

Values for each day:

* 'Signal' - 1 means "buy" or "hold" if you have no position, 0 - "do nothing" or "sell" existing position
* 'return_percent' day by day returns in percents
* 'return_dollar' day by day returns in dollars
* 'cumulative_percent' cumulative returns in percents
* 'drawdown_percent' day by day drawdowns in percents
* 'price' - it's recommended price to buy at or below. If you can buy below this price, your profit will be higher than stated in the rolling backtest.
* 'filtered_signal' and others with 'filtered_' tag - same strategy with a filtered signal (see below)

## Fees

We calculated max 0.1% fees of Bitfinex. If you can get lower fees, then price at whcih you should buy Bitcoin can be higher by the amount you save on fees or those savings would add to your surplus profit over rolling backtest.

## Filtered signal

Filtered strategy is same original Bitcoin strategy with improved risk profile.

It has 30% lower max drawdowns, 10% lower fees (and trades), 10% higher Sharpe and only 5% lower returns.

## How to get an API KEY for live signals

Here's how you can start earning using our services.

Memberships are limited, because cryptocurrencies have pretty low liquidity and we don't want to lose our trading edges by distributing them too broadly, so we can stop offering memberships at any time without notice. If we'll add more strategies, then it will be continued.
