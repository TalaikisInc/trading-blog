## Step 1 - Get API key

Go to our [plans](https://rapidapi.com/talaikis.tadas/api/blueblood-bitcoin-trading-signals/pricing) page.

Select Basic plan, this will be enough to cover all the signals from all strategies for each day<sup>*</sup>:

![Subscription plans](/static/1-1.png "Subscription plans")

You will be prompted to sign up page. Fill out the form or just click "Sign up with Facebook" or "Sign up with Google":

![Sign up page](/static/1-2.png "Sign up page")

After sign up you will be redirected back to plans page. Click "Select plan" again. You will be redirected to payment page: Fill out the form and click "Subscribe":

![Subsribe](/static/1-4.png "Subsribe")

Then you will be redirected to endpoints, and if not - click "Endpoints".

At the right side copy your key and save it to secure place<sup>**</sup>:

![Endpoints](/static/1-3.png "Endpoints")

Proceed to the next step:

<sup>*</sup> Note that 50 free requests a month are temporary, I plan to remove this plan in the near future.
<sup>**</sup> If you share your key with someone, remember that all requests above free limit are payable.

## Step 2 - Getting signals

Go to and bookmark [helper app](https://bitcoin.talaikis.com/)

Paste your API key:

![Enter API key in this box](/static/2-1.png "Enter API key in this box")

Click Submit and you'll see something like this:

![Bitcoin signals](/static/2-2.png "Bitcoin signals")

Now you can use signals from the strategies you want.

Note. Signals for next day are generated 23:59 (11:59 pm) GMT time each day and for weekly strategies for next week starting Monday on Sunday.

I recommend using [Portfolio of Bitcoin strategies](https://blueblood.talaikis.com/bitcoin-idx-trading-strategy).

If you prefer trading just once a week - use [Bitcoin S 2.0](https://blueblood.talaikis.com/bitcoin-s-2-trading-strategy) or [Bitcoin S 3.0](https://blueblood.talaikis.com/bitcoin-s-3-trading-strategy).

### Signals meaning

- > 0 - buy. For example, 1 means buy full position (depends on how much capital you allocate to the strategy), 0.25 - buy a quarter of your allocation.
- 0 - close existing position or do nothing
