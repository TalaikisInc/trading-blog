March, 2020 was one of the best months in 2020. 4 out of 9 strategies had the best month of the year to date.

All, but one of strategies produced positive returns ranging from 2.23 - 20.40%. Negative one produced -5.16.

All performance stats were changed from interday to intertrade, because we should not care about what happens inside a trade, we basically just need each trade and not each day to be positive. So, now all charts will clearly show when each trade generates a profit or loss.

Since tomorrow, new strategy will be added: [Bitcoin V](/bitcoin-v-trading-strategy).

Release of the arbitrage strategies is delayed and after the release they will also be expected to be experimental for some time, because they have some of the unknown variables, which are impossible to remove.
