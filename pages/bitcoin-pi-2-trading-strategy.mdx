# Why algorithmic trading?

There are many reasons:

* Don't stare at the screen all day, don't waste time, just watch for our signals once a day
* Don't overthink your decisions - with manual trading, you can enter and exit long trades several times and then just watch market goes up and you having no position. Instead, you can just rely on our tested, machine generated signals and not think twice for when to enter into a trade
* Don't be afraid, because our risk models will show you what risk to expect and will protect you from bigger loses when you just HODL
* Be sure. Access to technology that is often accessible only to investment banks, hedge funds and quantitative traders
* Don't be left alone - if some edges will fall, and this will happen, we'll just find new ones for you to enjoy
